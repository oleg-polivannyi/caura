"""Transient-error retry policy for core-storage-api HTTP clients.

Shared by core-api's ``CoreStorageClient`` and core-worker's storage
client so the two cannot silently diverge on what is safe to retry.

History (load-bearing for the policy split):

* F5 — Cloud Run logs over 7 days showed a 31% silent-failure rate on
  ``process_entity_extraction`` on ``staging-memclaw-core-api``. Every
  failure traced to ``httpx.ConnectTimeout`` reaching core-storage-api
  (cold starts / autoscaling). Retry landed for idempotent methods
  (GET, PATCH, DELETE) only.
* 2026-06-11 prod incident — ``find_similar_candidates`` (contradiction
  detection, 42 failures) and ``create_audit_logs_bulk`` (audit events
  dropped) both died on first-attempt ``ConnectTimeout`` behind the VPC
  connector because POSTs had no retry at all. Connection-phase retry
  for non-idempotent methods landed in response (caura-memclaw#333).
* 2026-06-16 prod — a steady trickle of ``httpx.ConnectTimeout`` still
  reached core-api on the Pub/Sub enrichment, entity-extraction,
  contradiction and audit-flush paths (storage-api cold starts /
  instance recycles). 3 attempts (~0.6s of backoff) is too short to
  ride out a cold start, so the connect-phase path now retries more
  times — see ``CONNECT_PHASE_MAX_ATTEMPTS``. This complements, not
  replaces, keeping storage-api warm (Cloud Run min-instances).

Retry policy:
 - Idempotent methods: max 3 attempts (1 initial + 2 retries), retry
   ``RETRYABLE_EXCEPTIONS`` plus ``RETRYABLE_STATUS_CODES``
   (use :func:`with_retry` defaults). Kept at 3 so a genuine 5xx
   storm isn't amplified by extra load against a struggling server.
 - Non-idempotent methods: ``CONNECT_PHASE_EXCEPTIONS`` ONLY
   (use :func:`with_connect_phase_retry`), max ``CONNECT_PHASE_MAX_ATTEMPTS``
   attempts. ConnectTimeout / ConnectError / PoolTimeout are all raised
   before a single request byte is written, so a retry cannot
   double-insert — and against an instance that isn't accepting yet
   they add no server load, so retrying more times just rides out the
   cold start. ReadTimeout and 5xx are NOT retried there — the request
   reached storage and may have committed; safe retry needs
   storage-side idempotency keys.
 - Exponential backoff with jitter, capped at ``RETRY_BACKOFF_MAX_S``.
