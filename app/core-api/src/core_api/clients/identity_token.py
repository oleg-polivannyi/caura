"""Cloud Run identity token fetching (CAURA-591 Part B, Y3).

Cloud Run services deployed with ``--no-allow-unauthenticated`` require
callers to present an ID token for a specific audience (the target
service URL). On Cloud Run the metadata server issues these tokens for
free to workloads with a service account attached; ``google.auth``
wraps the fetch.

Two failure modes get very different treatment:

1. ``google.auth`` isn't importable → permanent "no credentials" env
   (OSS install, local dev, tests). Cache the empty-header dict for
   the full TTL so we don't re-attempt imports on every request.
2. ``id_token.fetch_id_token(...)`` raised → could be a transient
   metadata-server hiccup. Cache an empty dict only for a brief
   cooldown (~30 s) so we retry quickly but don't stampede the
   metadata server mid-incident.

The sync ``google.auth`` call is offloaded via ``asyncio.to_thread``
so it doesn't block the event loop. Per-audience locks serialize
concurrent refreshes for the same audience without preventing
writer + reader tokens from being fetched in parallel.
