"""Concurrent embedding + LLM enrichment via asyncio.gather.

Deferral is now ``write_mode``-aware (restores the original CAURA-229
contract that the CAURA-524 step-consolidation + CAURA-595 PR-C global-
flag pattern inadvertently flattened):

* ``write_mode == "strong"`` → embed and enrich **always inline**,
  regardless of ``settings.deployment_mode``. Strong callers
  explicitly opted into "thorough write before commit"; the
  per-deploy mode targets fast-mode latency, not strong. Running
  inline here is what gives strong its meaningful guarantees —
  ``CheckSemanticDuplicate`` runs against a real embedding (so the
  409-on-near-duplicate contract holds), and the agent reads its own
  enriched ``title`` / ``memory_type`` / ``weight`` / ``status`` /
  ``ts_valid_*`` back in the response.
* ``write_mode == "fast"`` → LLM enrichment **always deferred**
  (matches CAURA-229's "fast = no LLM on the request path"
  intent). Embedding follows ``settings.inline_embedding`` so OSS
  local stays inline ~200ms while SaaS prod defers to ``core-worker``
  for the sub-2s p99 visibility SLA.
* Any other ``write_mode`` value (and the ``None`` case the
  enrichment-only sub-pipeline hits during extract-only / auto-chunk)
  reads both helpers — preserves today's behaviour for those
  branches.

Behind both deferred paths: ``ScheduleBackgroundTasks`` publishes
``Topics.Memory.EMBED_REQUESTED`` / ``Topics.Memory.ENRICH_REQUESTED``
so ``core-worker`` runs the provider call and PATCHes the row back.
Hint-based re-embed is DISABLED (CAURA-222): writes used to embed
``compose_embedding_text(content, retrieval_hint)`` while queries embed
raw text, producing a write/query surface asymmetry that capped recall
across dedup, entity-lookup, and search ranking. Until a symmetric
reintroduction lands, both the hot-path here and the background
re-embed in ``_enrich_memory_background`` embed raw ``content``.
