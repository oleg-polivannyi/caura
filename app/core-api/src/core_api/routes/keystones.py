"""Keystone rules — REST surface (CAURA-000).

Public mirror of the ``memclaw_keystones`` / ``memclaw_keystones_set``
MCP tools. Thin proxy over core-storage's ``/api/v1/storage/keystones``;
tiered trust enforcement (see the matrix below) and audit live in
core-api so the storage layer can stay a dumb CRUD service.

Endpoints (under ``/api/v1``):
* ``GET    /memclaw/keystones`` — list scope-merged rules
* ``POST   /memclaw/keystones`` — upsert a rule (tiered trust; see below)
* ``DELETE /memclaw/keystones/{doc_id}`` — remove a rule (tiered trust)

Trust gating is dynamic per the targeted rule's scope:

* ``scope=agent`` AND ``agent_id == caller`` → **trust ≥ 1** (self-author).
* Anything else (``scope=fleet`` / ``scope=tenant`` / cross-agent
  ``scope=agent``) → **trust ≥ 2**.

Surface the ``X-Truncated`` header from core-storage so callers can warn
operators when rules are being silently dropped.
