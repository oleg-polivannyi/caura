"""Tokenizer for entity FTS lookups.

Shared by every call site that feeds ``fts_search_entities``: the
``ClassifyQuery`` pipeline step, ``_entity_boost_pipeline`` in
``memory_service``, and the ``ParallelEmbedEntityBoost`` pipeline step.
Keeping one tokenizer means a single place to harden against
UUID-fragment / content-hash leaks into the entity FTS index — the
``empty-query-nonempty`` loadtest finding came from each site
calling ``query.split()`` independently and sending unbroken
hyphenated strings to storage, which then re-tokenised server-side
on punctuation and matched UUID chunks against indexed entities.
