# instead of hitting the already-warm model. This is the "registry's
# per-model instance cache" that ``LocalEmbedding.dedup_scope`` was
# already written against.
#
# Unlike ``_openai_provider_cache`` there is no eviction: nothing to
# close (no connection pool, no credential to rotate), and the key space
# is env-driven (``LOCAL_EMBEDDING_MODEL``), so a process realistically
# holds one entry. No lock either — there is no await between lookup and
# insert, so coroutines can't interleave a double-construct, and
# construction is cheap anyway (the model load is lazy and
# single-flighted behind the instance's ``_load_lock``).

# holds a long-lived ``AsyncOpenAI`` (and therefore a long-lived
# ``httpx.AsyncClient`` connection pool); without the cache, every
# ``get_embedding`` call from core-api would build a fresh pool and
# pay a TLS handshake to api.openai.com on every request. Multi-tenant
# safe: keying on ``api_key`` keeps tenant-A's client from being
# reused for tenant-B's request. The platform-tier singleton has its
# own caching (managed in ``_platform.py``) — we don't double-cache it.
#
# LRU-bounded so a rotated/revoked tenant key eventually gets evicted
# instead of pinning a 401-returning client forever. ``OrderedDict``

# when full. 256 is well above any realistic tenant count for a single
# process; raise if that proves wrong.

# Eviction must explicitly close the evicted provider's httpx pool
# (CAURA-627). The OpenAI SDK now gets a user-provided ``http_client``
# (set in ``OpenAIEmbeddingProvider.__init__`` so we control pool
# sizing); per the SDK contract, user-provided clients are NOT closed
# on SDK teardown — caller owns cleanup. ``_get_or_create_openai_provider``
# below schedules ``aclose()`` on the evicted instance via
# ``asyncio.create_task`` so the pool drains in the background instead
# of leaking ``ResourceWarning`` and held connections under long-lived
