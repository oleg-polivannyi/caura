# ── Retry policy ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# provider (configured via ``call_with_fallback``). Linear backoff
# rather than exponential because the LLM call is already slow (1-3s)
# and a multi-second backoff would push the request past timeout.
#
# This is the ONLY retry layer, which it previously was not — see
# ``LLM_PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES``. Worth reading the two together: the
# reason for linear backoff above is the same reason a second, hidden,
# EXPONENTIAL backoff underneath it was wrong.
LLM_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 2
LLM_RETRY_DELAY_S = 1.0

# Longest ``Retry-After`` this layer will actually wait out.
#
# Pinning the SDK's retries (below) also dropped its ``Retry-After``
# compliance, so ``call_with_retry`` honours the header itself now — but it
# cannot honour it unconditionally, because every budget above it is small
# and fixed:
#
#   dedup_judge            per-attempt wait_for   10 s
#   recall_service         per-attempt wait_for   15 s
#   BULK_ENRICHMENT_TOTAL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS         30 s
#   enrichment_inline_timeout_seconds             35 s
#
# A provider saying "come back in 60 s" is entirely normal, and sleeping
# that out inside a 15 s budget is strictly worse than not retrying: the
# outer timeout fires having spent the whole window asleep. So a hint over
# this cap ends the retry loop instead, which hands the call to
# ``call_with_fallback``'s second provider — the right response to "this
# provider is rate-limited for the next minute", and one the old hidden
# SDK retries could never make because they had no idea a fallback
# existed.
#
# 5 s because it must leave room for the retry it precedes: the tightest
# budget is 10 s and a request can take ``OPENAI_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``,
# so anything much larger cannot fit a wait AND an attempt.
LLM_MAX_RETRY_AFTER_S = _read_float_env("LLM_MAX_RETRY_AFTER_S", 5.0)

# Fraction of the delay added as random jitter, so concurrent callers stop
# retrying in lockstep.
#
# The lockstep is real, not theoretical: ``BULK_ENRICHMENT_CONCURRENCY``
# is 10, so a bulk write fires ten enrichment calls at once. With a purely
# linear delay, a provider that rate-limits the batch gets all ten back at
# the same instant, one second later — which is how a rate limit sustains
# itself. Jitter is part of the same fix as the header handling above:
# both are about not hammering a provider that just said no.
#
# Additive only (see ``call_with_retry``), so it can never undercut a
# ``Retry-After``. ``random`` rather than ``secrets`` is deliberate — this
# schedules a sleep, it does not protect anything.
#
# Floored at 0 rather than trusted, because "additive only" is an
# invariant this value can break: ``read_float_env`` deliberately permits
# negatives, and a negative fraction makes ``random.uniform`` return an
# offset that SUBTRACTS from the delay — sleeping less than a provider's
# ``Retry-After`` asked for, which is the one thing the ordering in
# ``call_with_retry`` exists to prevent. An env var must not be able to
# invert a documented guarantee silently.

# Retries the OpenAI-compatible SDK performs INSIDE one provider call.
# Zero, so ``call_with_retry`` above is the whole retry policy.
#
# Left unset, the SDK applies ``DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES = 2`` — three HTTP
# requests per call, on 429/408/409/5xx and connection errors. Nothing
# pinned it, so the real request count was the PRODUCT of every layer:
#
#   call_with_fallback (2 providers)
#     x call_with_retry (LLM_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 2)
#       x the SDK (3 requests)
#   = up to 12 HTTP requests for one logical LLM call, where the code
#     reads as 4.
#
# Invisible at every level that could have caught it: SDK retries emit no
# log line, so ``call_with_retry``'s "attempt 1/2 failed" covered up to
# three real requests, and the two are indistinguishable in any provider
# dashboard or spend report.
#
# Three concrete harms, not tidiness:
#
#  1. It overrode callers that had explicitly opted OUT of retrying.
#     ``recall_service`` passes ``max_attempts=1`` precisely to fail fast
#     to the fallback provider rather than retry a slow primary — and
#     then got three tries anyway, with exponential backoff, inside a
#     15 s budget.
#  2. It broke the timeout arithmetic that the inline and bulk ceilings
#     were derived from. ``OPENAI_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` is per
#     REQUEST, so one "attempt" is up to 75 s — over
#     ``enrichment_inline_timeout_seconds`` (35 s) and
#     ``BULK_ENRICHMENT_TOTAL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` (30 s) on the FIRST
#     attempt, when both were sized believing an attempt was one request.
#  3. Its backoff contradicts the documented policy directly. The comment
#     above chose linear delay because "a multi-second backoff would push
#     the request past timeout" — while the SDK was applying exactly that
#     underneath, inside the budget the choice was protecting.
#
# Accepted cost, stated plainly: the SDK honours ``Retry-After`` and
# jitters its backoff, and ``call_with_retry`` does neither. That matters
# more here than on the embedding side, because this client serves three
# HOSTED APIs with real per-org rate limits (OpenAI, Anthropic,
# OpenRouter) rather than a self-hosted backend. It is still the right
# trade today: callers wrap each attempt in ``asyncio.wait_for`` at 10-15 s,
# which cancels a respectful ``Retry-After`` wait long before it
# completes, so the compliance was mostly theoretical. The real fix is to
# teach ``call_with_retry`` about ``Retry-After`` — where it is visible
# and inside the budget accounting — not to keep a second retry layer
# that no caller can see.
#
# ``minimum=0`` because 0 is the intended value and ``read_int_env``'s
# usual floor of 1 would make it arrive by FALLING BACK rather than by
# being accepted. Env-tunable purely so an incident can restore the old

# ── httpx pool sizing for OpenAI-compatible providers ────────────────

# ``BULK_ENRICHMENT_CONCURRENCY=10`` x ``per_tenant_write_concurrency=16``
# in flight per worker — the pool saturates and queues subsequent
# requests, including other tenants'. The defaults were sized for
# request/response patterns where one user's bursty fan-out doesn't
# sit on top of another tenant's traffic; our hot-path enrichment is
# exactly that pattern.
#
# Sized for headroom over the worst-case fan-out per process. Env-
# tunable so an operator can adjust during an incident (e.g. if the
# upstream provider's per-IP cap is hit) without a redeploy.

# intermittently exceeds 5 s. Observed in prod as a steady trickle of
# ``httpcore.ConnectTimeout`` from the enrichment / entity-extraction
# handlers ("pubsub handler raised; nacking for redelivery" +
